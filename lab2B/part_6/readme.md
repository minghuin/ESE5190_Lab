# Part 6 REPL+PIO_Logic_Analyzer

Based on the logic analyzer example implemented by the pio module, I integrated the REPL and the logic analyzer. The pio program is the same with the pico-example's logic analyzer example. All the processing logic is implemented in C. Also, I have added the feature of transition encoding.
